DailyNumpy
==========

DailyNumpy is a website for learning about Numpy, Scipy, and 
related libraries.  Every day (or as often as I can manage), I
will create a little IPython notebook that shows how to use
some functionality in Numpy.  The goal is to have a useful
small tutorial that someone can read while sipping their morning
coffee.

Each tutorial will be rated Novice, Intermediate, or Advanced.
Most things will Novice or Intermediate, and those functions
will be prioritized over Advanced functionality.
